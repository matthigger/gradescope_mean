# category:
#   weight:
#     hw: 50
#     exam: 50
#   drop_low:
#     hw: 2

# what this does:
# half the final grade is hw, the other half is exams.
# each student's 2 lowest hw scores are dropped.
# assignments are matched to categories by substring, so "HW 3" matches
# "hw" and "Exam - Midterm1 version A" matches "exam"

# category:
#   late_penalty:
#     hw:
#       penalty_per_day: .15
#       excuse_day: 3
#       grace_period_minutes: 60
#       excuse_day_offset:
#         student@uni.edu: 4

# what this does:
# each unexcused late day costs 15% of the average hw.
# every student gets 3 free late days across all hw assignments.
# submissions within 60 minutes of the deadline are not counted as late.
# student@uni.edu gets 4 extra excuse days (7 total), e.g. for a DRC
# accommodation.

# assignments:
#   exclude_complete_thresh: .6
#   exclude:
#     - practice quiz
#     - exam1 v2
#   substitute:
#     quiz1:
#       - quiz1 v2
#       - quiz1 v3

# what this does:
# auto-exclude any assignment where fewer than 60% of students submitted.
# also exclude "practice quiz" and "exam1 v2" by name.
# replace each student's quiz1 score with the max of quiz1, quiz1 v2,
# and quiz1 v3 (useful for multiple versions of the same quiz).
# be sure to also exclude the alternates so they don't double-count.

# waive:
#   student@uni.edu: hw3
#   other@uni.edu: hw1, hw2, hw3

# what this does:
# drop hw3 for student (as if it was never assigned).
# drop hw1, hw2, and hw3 for other.
# when a student emails about a missed assignment, add a line here.

# waive_late:
#   student@uni.edu: hw4

# what this does:
# forgive the late penalty on hw4 for student@uni.edu, but the score still counts.

# email_list:
#   - name0@uni.edu
#   - name1@uni.edu

# what this does:
# only these students appear in output; everyone else is dropped.
# emails are matched by prefix (before @), so student@husky.neu.edu
# matches student@northeastern.edu.
